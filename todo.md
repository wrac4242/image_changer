# To Do list
basic way of seeing what needs to be done and how to structure it

## main todo list
+ add some basic filters to the code
- replace all of colour 1 with colour 2
- black white to a different colour
- thermal like camera
- background filter
- blur filter

+ add information commands to the code
- average colour?
- total amount of different colours?
- most common colour?

+ add a way to run 3x3 filters on it
- closure that takes in an array of 9 pixels, allows doing stuff to said array
- or a vector array?

+ change all pixels to the closest of some given pixels
- takes in vector array?
- how do we deal with closest?

+ copy parts of the image
- export set portions of the image

+ allow image overlaying at set coordinates
- how would you combine it?
- option for overlaying or average of the two colours?

+ do a function on a set area of the image - doable with just an if statement i guess
